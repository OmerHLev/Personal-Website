	<h3>Welcome to my website!</h3>
	<p>This is my personal website, which I've built during my QA course at <a href="https://automation.co.il/" target="_blank">automation.co.il</a>. </br>
	You can find here information about me, my previous projects, contact information, and even a simple guide on how to make your first Dungeons and Dragons character!

	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>My name is Omer Lev, I'm 25 years old and live in Tel Aviv. I'm a graduate of a gifted students' class and a code and technology enthusiast. </br>
	During my high school years I've participated in a program called "Computational science" at <a href="https://www.hemda.org.il/" target="_blank">Hemda</a> center in Tel Aviv, </br>
	where we would submit each year a project of a scientific simulation we wrote in python. </br>
	One of my projects won the 2nd place award at the Schwartz-Reisman competition. </br> </br>
	During the years after High school I've done many online courses in several subjects, but all coding related.</br>
	For more information, you can check out the Projects page where I detail my previous works. </br>
	Other than that, I'm a video games geek, a lover of cats, and I play Dungeons & Dragons regularly with a group of friends.

	<h3>Why QA?</h3>
	<p> It's quite obvious that I'm interested in code, coding, and tech in general, but one might wonder: Why QA specifically? </br> </br>
		First off, I believe I'm more suited for it. One of the core traits you need for QA is a mind for finding the faults in systems. </br>
		For me, it is always natural to look for edge cases, and try to find the problems in systems, plans, code, and even ordinary day-to-day things. </br>
		Therefore, I believe I can be a valuable addition to any QA team. </br> </br>
		Second, I enjoy the systems-oriented thinking that can often be found within QA. </br>
		To me, it is more interesting to write a testing framewrok (whether manual or automated) aimed at ensuring a lack of bugs (as much as that is possible)</br>
		than it is to implement any specific feature within the system. </br> </br>
		Lastly, it seems to me from friends and family within the High-Tech industry that QA as a field has a lack of serious long-term canidates. </br>
		I've been told many times that for many, QA is an entry way job, for those who eventually want to become junior developers themselves. </br>
		This causes a lack of high quality QA personnel. Since QA is interesting in and of itself to me, I believe I can contribute a lot in the short and long terms.
