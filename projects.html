		<h3>Personal Website</h3>
		<p>
		During my QA course, our first module was an HTML exercise to write our own website. </br>
		To build this website I had to learn basic HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. </br>
		Additionally I learned some basic graphic design skills to make the website look more proffesional, </br>
		and I even added my old pixel art assets (the background for the D&D page).</br> </br>
		This project was a fun experience of making a website from scratch, and I learned alot from it. </br>
		In the future, I will update this website with other projects I make, and perhaps other content. </br>
		</br></br></br>

		<h3>Wordle Automation Demo</h3>
		<p>
		This project I made during an online course I did about Selenium in Python.</br>
		to challenge myself, I decided to write a functional demo based on what I learned during my course. </br> </br>
		In this project, I wrote a pytest framework to run automated scripts on the NYT famous game 
		<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target ="_blank">Wordle</a>. </br>
		Within this framework I wrote a few testing scripts, but the major ones are a script that grabs the correct word of the day </br>
		and a script that guesses 6 random words, weighted for how common they are, and compares the guess results to the correct word. </br>
		This basic demo can be used to ensure that Wordle gives correct results to guesses. </br> </br>
		During this project I learned Selenium, Github, Jenkins, Pytest, and other tools I've used for the project.</br>
